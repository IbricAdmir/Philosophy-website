      <p>Nihilism is the belief that there is no meaning to anything, for example religion, governing bodies or a supposed structure to the world has no deeper meaning in the eyes of a nihilist, there is no deeper reason to it's existence.
        In most cases a nihilist is taken as probably a depressed, angry at the world, basement dweller type individual but this is not at all the case here.
        Often times people question why things are the way that they are in our world, *why do we live? why does religion exist? why does the government exist?* and so and so forth.
        It's always that question, why?</p>
      <p>For nihilists there is no reason to ponder these never ending questions because in their eyes there is no deeper meaning to things.</p>
